Given an array arr[] of integers. Find a peak element i.e. an element that is not smaller than its neighbors. 

Note: For corner elements, we need to consider only one neighbor. 

Example:

Input: array[]= {5, 10, 20, 15}
Output: 20
Explanation: The element 20 has neighbors 10 and 15, both of them are less than 20.



//CODE

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int n;
	cin>>n;
	int a[n];
	for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
	cin>>a[i];
	int max=0;
	for(int i=1; i<n-1; i++)
	{
		if((a[i-1]<a[i]) && (a[i]>a[i+1]))
		max=a[i]; 
	}
	cout<<max<<endl;
}
