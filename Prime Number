#Write a program to find wheather a given number is prime or not. A prime number is a number which has only 2 factors 1 and itself. It has not other factors. For example number 11 is prime , but number 10 is not prime because it has 1,2,5,10 as its factors.

Take n as input using scanf, Output "yes" if number is prime, otherwise print "no



#Solution

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int n, value=0;
    cin>>n;
    for(int i=1; i<=n; i++)
    {
        if(n%i==0)
        value++;
    }
    if(value!=2) cout<<"no"<<endl;
    else cout<<"yes"<<endl;
}
